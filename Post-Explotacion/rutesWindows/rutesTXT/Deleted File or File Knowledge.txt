Thumbcache

Content:
Description:
Thumbnails of pictures, office documents, and folders exist in
a database called the thumbcache. Each user will have their

• These are created when a user switches a folder to
thumbnail mode or views pictures via a slide show. As it
were, our thumbs are now stored in separate database files.
Win7+ has 4 sizes for thumbnails and the files in the cache
folder reflect this:
- 32 -> small - 96 -> medium
- 256 -> large - 1024 -> extra large
• The thumbcache will store the thumbnail copy of the picture
based on the thumbnail size in the content of the equivalent
database file.

network shares) file access, giving us an excellent means for
determining which files and applications were accessed on
the system, day by day.
