Name:
Windows 10 Timeline

Content:   
Description:
Win10 records recently used applications and files in a
“timeline” accessible via the “WIN+TAB” key. The data is
recorded in a SQLite database.

Platform\L.<profile>\ActivitiesCache.db

Interpretation:
• Application execution
• Focus count per application

Name:
RecentApps

Content:   
Description:
GUI Program execution launched on the Win10 system is
tracked in the RecentApps key

Location:
Win10:
NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Search\RecentApps

Interpretation:
Each GUID key points to a recent application.
AppID = Name of Application
LastAccessTime = Last execution time in UTC
LaunchCount = Number of times executed

Name:
Shimcache

Content:   
Description:
• Windows Application Compatibility Database is used by
Windows to identify possible application compatibility
challenges with executables.
• Tracks the executables file name, file size, last modified time,
and in Windows XP the last update time

Location:
XP:
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\AppCompatibility
Win7/8/10:
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache

Interpretation:
Any executable run on the Windows system could be found
in this key. You can use this key to identify systems that
specific malware was executed on. In addition, based on the
interpretation of the time-based data you might be able to
determine the last time of execution or activity on the system.
• Windows XP contains at most 96 entries
- LastUpdateTime is updated when the files are executed
• Windows 7 contains at most 1,024 entries
- LastUpdateTime does not exist on Win7 systems

Name:
Jump Lists

Content:   
Description:
• The Windows 7 task bar (Jump List) is engineered to allow
users to “jump” or access items they have frequently or
recently used quickly and easily. This functionality cannot
only include recent media files; it must also include recent
tasks.
• The data stored in the AutomaticDestinations folder will
each have a unique file prepended with the AppID of the
associated application. 

Location:
Win7/8/10:
C:\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\
AutomaticDestinations

Interpretation:
• First time of execution of application.
- Creation Time = First time item added to the AppID file.
• Last time of execution of application w/file open.
- Modification Time = Last time item added to the AppID file.

Name:
Amcache.hve
   
Content:
Description:
ProgramDataUpdater (a task associated with the Application
Experience Service) uses the registry file Amcache.hve to store
data during process creation

Location:
Win7/8/10:
C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve

Interpretation:
• Amcache.hve – Keys = Amcache.hve\Root\File\{Volume GUID}\#######
• Entry for every executable run, full path information, File’s
$StandardInfo Last Modification Time, and Disk volume the
executable was run from
• First Run Time = Last Modification Time of Key
• SHA1 hash of executable also contained in the key

Name:
System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM)
   
Content:
Description:
Records 30 to 60 days of historical system performance.
Applications run, user account responsible for each, and
