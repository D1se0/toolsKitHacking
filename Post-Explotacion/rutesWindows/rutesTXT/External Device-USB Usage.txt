Key Identification

Content:
Description:
Track USB devices plugged into a machine

Location:
• SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR
• SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB

Interpretation:
• Identify vendor, product, and version of a USB device
plugged into a machine
• Identify a unique USB device plugged into the machine
• Determine the time a device was plugged into the
machine
• Devices that do not have a unique serial number will

Content:
Description:
Determine temporal usage of specific USB devices
connected to a Windows Machine.

Location:
Plug and Play Log Files
XP:
C:\Windows\setupapi.log
Win7/8/10:
C:\Windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log

Interpretation:
• Search for Device Serial Number
• Log File times are set to local time zone
Location First, Last, and Removal Times
(Win7/8/10 Only)
System Hive:
\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\Ven_Prod_Version\USBSerial#\Properties\
{83da6326-97a6-4088-9453-a19231573b29}\####
0064 = First Install (Win7-10)
0066 = Last Connected (Win8-10)
0067 = Last Removal (Win8-10)

Name:
User

Content:
Description
Find User that used the Unique USB Device

Location:
• Look for GUID from SYSTEM\MountedDevices
• NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\
MountPoints2

Interpretation:
This GUID will be used next to identify the user that
plugged in the device. The last write time of this key
also corresponds to the last time the device was
plugged into the machine by that user. The number
will be referenced in the user’s personal mountpoints
key in the NTUSER.DAT Hive.

Name:
PnP Events

Content:
Description:
When a Plug and Play driver install is
attempted, the service will log an ID
20001 event and provide a Status within
the event. It is important to note that
this event will trigger for any Plug and
Play-capable device, including but not
limited to USB, Firewire, and PCMCIA
devices

Location:
Win7/8/10:
%system root%\System32\winevt\logs\System.evtx

Interpretation:
• Event ID: 20001 – Plug and Play driver
install attempted
• Event ID 20001
• Timestamp
• Device information
• Device serial number
• Status (0 = no errors)

Name:
Volume Serial Number

Content:
Description:
Discover the Volume Serial Number of
the Filesystem Partition on the USB.
(NOTE: This is not the USB Unique Serial
Number, which is hardcoded into the
device firmware.)

Location:
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\
ENDMgmt
• Use Volume Name and USB Unique
Serial Number to:
 - Find last integer number in line
 - Convert Decimal Serial Number into
Hex Serial Number

Interpretation:
• Knowing both the Volume Serial
Number and the Volume Name,
you can correlate the data across
SHORTCUT File (LNK) analysis and the
RECENTDOCs key.
• The Shortcut File (LNK) contains the
Volume Serial Number and Name
• RecentDocs Registry Key, in most
cases, will contain the volume name
when the USB device is opened via
Explorer

Name:
Drive Letter and Volume Name

Content:
Description:
Discover the last drive letter of the USB
Device when it was plugged into the machine.

• Using ParentIdPrefix Discover Last Mount Point
– SYSTEM\MountedDevices
Win7/8/10:
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Portable Devices\Devices
• SYSTEM\MountedDevices
- Examine Drive Letters looking at Value
Data Looking for Serial Number

Interpretation:
