- Event ID 4778 – Session Connected/Reconnected
- Event ID 4779 – Session Disconnected
• Event log provides hostname and IP address of remote

Logon Types
   
Content:
Description:
Logon Events can give us very specific information regarding
the nature of account authorizations on a system if we know
where to look and how to decipher the data that we find. In
addition to telling us the date, time, username, hostname, and
success/failure status of a logon, Logon Events also enables us
to determine by exactly what means a logon was attempted.
