Timezone
   
Content:
Description:
Identifies the current system time zone

Location:
SYSTEM Hive:
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation

Interpretation:
• Time activity is incredibly useful for correlation of activity
• Internal log files and date/timestamps will be based on the
system time zone information
• You might have other network devices and you will need to
correlate information to the time zone information collected here.

Name:
Network History
   
Content:
Description:
• Identify networks that the computer has been connected to
• Networks could be wireless or wired
• Identify domain name/intranet name
• Identify SSID
• Identify Gateway MAC Address

Location:
Win7/8/10 SOFTWARE HIVE:
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Unmanaged
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Managed
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Nla\Cache

Interpretation:
• Identifying intranets and networks that a computer has
connected to is incredibly important
• Not only can you determine the intranet name, you can
determine the last time the network was connected to it based
on the last write time of the key
• This will also list any networks that have been connected to via
a VPN
• MAC Address of SSID for Gateway could be physically triangulated

Name:
WLAN Event Log
   
Content:
Description:
Determine what wireless networks the system associated with and
identify network characteristics to find location
Relevant Event IDs
• 11000 – Wireless network association started
• 8001 – Successful connection to wireless network
• 8002 – Failed connection to wireless network
• 8003 – Disconnect from wireless network
• 6100 – Network diagnostics (System log)

Location:
Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig Operational.evtx

Interpretation:
• Shows historical record of wireless network connections
• Contains SSID and BSSID (MAC address), which can be used to
geolocate wireless access point *(no BSSID on Win8+)

Name:
Browser Search Terms
   
Content:
Description:
